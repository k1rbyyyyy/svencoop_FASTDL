LEVEL DESCRIPTION:

Fun map with a outer space zombie alien planet theme. Many secrets! I used ideas from my buddy Cuda's map, battlegrounds but this map was built from scratch. Mainly the outer (middle area) is similar to Cuda's map. Always loved his map!

SERVER ADMIN NOTES: The map sets all players to be equiped with weapons and ammo every
time they spawn. Since the players spawn with weapons, those weapons are not available for pickup
but ammo is available. This was done to cut back on the amount of entities in the map in hopes to prevent
the map from crashing due to the large amount of entities already in the map.
